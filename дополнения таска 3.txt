Added Bootstrap CDN:
I included Bootstrap via a CDN link in the <head> section to use its pre-built styles and components without custom CSS.
Page Structure:
Header: Added a header with my name, profession, and a tagline using Bootstrap's classes for text alignment, background, and padding.
About Me Section: Used a Bootstrap container to format the bio and ensure proper spacing with margin utilities.
Skills Section: Implemented a list of skills using Bootstrap's list-group component to create a structured and styled list.
Experience & Education: Similar to the skills section, both experience and education were styled with the list-group to present information cleanly.
Contact Section: Added a button linking to Lionel Messi's Instagram using Bootstrap’s btn and btn-outline-primary classes, along with a placeholder email.
Responsive Layout:
Used Bootstrap’s grid system and utility classes (like container, my-4, etc.) to ensure that the page adjusts smoothly on different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobiles).
No Custom CSS:
The page layout and styling were achieved using only Bootstrap’s built-in classes, making the code simpler and easier to maintain.
