Changes to the second assignment:
1) Responsive Design:
Added media queries for responsive design to make the page look good on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops. For example, resized fonts and images on screens up to 600px wide, and changed the hobby layout from horizontal to vertical.
2) CSS Transitions and Animations:
Added a smooth effect to the hobby section when hovering over images. When hovering, the images are enlarged, creating a visually appealing effect.
3) Custom Buttons and Interactions:
Contact links in the footer are styled as buttons with color change on hover. This is done to improve user interaction with elements on the page.
4) Advanced Layouts with Flexbox:
Used Flexbox to organize the hobby section, making it convenient to place elements on the screen and adaptive. This provides flexibility in placing content on different devices.
5) Box Model and Spacing:
Adjusted indents and margins to create a visually balanced layout, providing adequate space between elements and sections.
